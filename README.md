# S4RB-CT-Home-Automation

### A project performed with 2 people, during my specialization called: Creative Technology

The project is a React.js front end, which uses Axios Api calls to communicate with the Emotiv Cortex API.

The goal of this project was to help impaired people use their home automation devices (smart lights, smart curtains, etc) with nothing but their brain activity.

The Emotiv Epoc-x headset was used in combination with the Emotiv headset, to gain insights into the brain activity. A common pattern of certain activity
could be mapped to a command, which we used to control the home automation devices.
